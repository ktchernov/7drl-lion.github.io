Dig Deep - Roguelike game
=========================

Simple: dig as deep as you can and collect as much gold as you can without getting killed!

Based on a 7-day Roguelike "Lyon's Den". Music and sound-effects were added and the gameplay was refined and enhanced.

Gold was added to give something to strive to - gain as much gold as you can, and this is recorded in your personal high score.

A key feature of the game was added - digging. You're in a dark dungeon, filled with rubble, might as well dig your way through! But be careful, digging attracts enemies.

Based on the forked project, "Lyon's Den" by Lion. Written for GitHub Game Off 2015 "The Game Has Changed" - https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed
